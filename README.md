# PhoenixBot

Info:
PhoenixBot is a Discord Bot made by Raduino. Has diffrent commands and I am adding some everyday! If you want to improve the bot please contact me on Discord: Raduino#0006 or add more code here.

Installation:
To install PhoenixBot and run it you need to have node.js installed in your pc then you need VisualStudio Code. After that unzip the file and go in the file. There you will see a zip called node_modules. Unzip it and delete the zip. Then open the project with VSCode. Press the view button then go to integrated terminal. There do "node bot.js" and the bot will start! You may change some things:
- Change the token if config.json.
- Change the prefix.
- Chnage the owner id. Put your id there.




Thanks for using the bot!
